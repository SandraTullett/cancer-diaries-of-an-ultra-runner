      <p class="w3-large">
        I have been a keen runner for many years.
        I ran my first marathon in 2004 and promptly said 'never again'.
        However, I have now run over 100 marathons and didn't stop there.
        I increased my distance from a marathon to 50 miles, 100 miles and beyond.
        This culminated, in June 2017, with me running the Thames Ring 250 mile ultra event.
        I was fit, healthy and strong.
        However, in November that same year I was diagnosed with breast cancer and my future hopes and dreams were taken from me.
        I expected that I would not be running for quite some time.
      </p>

      <p class="w3-large">
        However, when I found out that exercise was encouraged and other cancer patients had managed to run during their treatment, I decided to continue to run throughout whenever I felt well enough.
        If I couldn't run then I would walk. i set targets to reach through my treatment and had a goal for when everything wasover.
        Running became my therapy and also gave me soem control in a period of my life where I felt that I had little.
        I started to write a diary and I found comfort doing this. With my husband, Russ', continual encouragement my diary has now been tranasformed into a book
        which gives a full account of how running helped me through my breast cancer journey and beyond..
